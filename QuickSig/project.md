# Parts

    Atmega8 (1)
    22pf capacitor (2)
    10K resistor (1)
    2.2K resistor (1)
    220 resistor (1)

    5v power supply (1)

Burned Arduino bootloader for atmega8 with Arduino uno r3
programmed atmega8 using Arduino uno board and Arduino ide (by r3eplacing the atmega328 chip on uno with atmega 8 as the pin layout is same everything will work fine)
later i got access to USB to TTL convertor by this atmega8 can be programmed
